## Parity Bits Calculator

This project is a simple C program that calculates the even parity bit and odd parity bit for a binary message entered by the user. The calculated parity bits are then appended to the original message.


## Prerequisites

A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system

## How to Run

Clone this repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/notashwinii/parity.git
cd parity
```

Compile the program:
```bash
gcc parity.c -o parity
```
Run the program:
```bash
./parity_bits
```
On Windows, use:
```
parity_bits.exe
```
## Example Usage
```
Enter a binary message (only 0s and 1s): 101010
```
```
Original binary message: 101010
Even parity bit: 1
Message with even parity bit appended: 1010101
Odd parity bit: 0
Message with odd parity bit appended: 1010100
```
